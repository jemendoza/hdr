Depot: Multiple
Constraints: Depot demmand, capacity, multi run
Characteristics: Heterogeneus Fleet, a percentage of clients in a route can be out of the service zone
Technique: Combination of heuristics improved by a Tabu Search Algorithm
Application: DSS
Benchmark: Own Instances


Aporte:
* Dise√±o de un DSS para un caso particular de una compa√±ia de carne en espa√±a que
 enfocado a la mejora del servicio al cliente, que ha logrado reducir hasta en un 80% los retardos de entregas.

Ideas: 
* En el paper los clientes est√°n pre-clusterizados para aprovechar el conocimiento de la zona que tienen los conductores
* Utilizar el retardo como una medida de rendimiento dado que los costos del transporte son independientes de la distancia sin 
 olvidar que la minimizaci√≥n de la misma es un valor agregado para los conductores
* Utilizar velocidades promedio diferentes dependiendo el lugar de la ciudad en el que se mueve el veh√≠culo

Notas:
* El paper tiene un metodo para calcular distancias entre puntos de forma "facil" y "barata"
* El programa que propone el paper tiene funcionalidad completa de DSS a pesar de no integrar sistemas de informaci√≥n de varios tipicos
 como sugiere la arquitectura DSS
* Sirve de referencia para decir que los algoritmos de la academia distan de los problemas reales
* Las instancias son de un tama√±o parecido a las tratadas en nuestro proyecto (al rededor de 500 clientes)},

This paper describes and compares four new integer linear programming formulations for the GVRP, two based on multicommodity flow and the other two based on exponential-size sets of inequalities. Branch-and-cut algorithms are proposed for the latter two. Computational results on a large set of instances are presented.},

Depot: Single
Constraints: Soft time windows, Pre-assigned service zones, Capacity, Route Duration, Number of vehicles
Characteristics: Heterogeneus Fleet, a percentage of clients in a route can be out of the service zone
Technique: Combination of heuristics improved by a Tabu Search Algorithm
Application: DSS
Benchmark: Own Instances


Aporte:
* Dise√±o de un DSS para un caso particular de una compa√±ia de carne en espa√±a que
 enfocado a la mejora del servicio al cliente, que ha logrado reducir hasta en un 80% los retardos de entregas.

Ideas: 
* En el paper los clientes est√°n pre-clusterizados para aprovechar el conocimiento de la zona que tienen los conductores
* Utilizar el retardo como una medida de rendimiento dado que los costos del transporte son independientes de la distancia sin 
 olvidar que la minimizaci√≥n de la misma es un valor agregado para los conductores
* Utilizar velocidades promedio diferentes dependiendo el lugar de la ciudad en el que se mueve el veh√≠culo

Notas:
* El paper tiene un metodo para calcular distancias entre puntos de forma "facil" y "barata"
* El programa que propone el paper tiene funcionalidad completa de DSS a pesar de no integrar sistemas de informaci√≥n de varios tipicos
 como sugiere la arquitectura DSS
* Sirve de referencia para decir que los algoritmos de la academia distan de los problemas reales
* Las instancias son de un tama√±o parecido a las tratadas en nuestro proyecto (al rededor de 500 clientes)},

Characteristics: Service orders Priority, Multiperiod
Technique: Heuristics combined with tabu search
Application: Stand Alone Application
Benchmark: 


Aporte:
* Dise√±o e implementaci√≥n de una aplicaci√≥n para generar las rutas de t√©cnicos para el mantenimiento de elevadores en Schindler.
* Reducciones de un millon de dolares anuales gracias a la implementaci√≥n.

Ideas: 

Notas:
* Se presentan dos tipos de problema, elaborar rutas para mantenimientos predefinidas de acuerdo a la frecuencia y responder a llamados de emergencia.
 El primer problema se resuelve con OR y el otro es una simple asignaci√≥n tipor nearest insertion en la ruta del t√©cnico que se encuentre m√°s cerca.
* Cluster First (asignaci√≥n de clientes a t√©cnicos) Route Second (elaboraci√≥n de la ruta de cada t√©cnico)
* Se utiliza una funci√≥n objetivo que pondera, el tiempo oscioso, la distancia total recorrida, el costo de las horas extras y el costo de violar las ventanas de tiempo
* El clustering se hace relajando todas las restricciones.
* No se explican ni las heuristicas ni el dise√±o de la b√∫squeda tabu.
* En un anexo se muestra la formulaci√≥n del problema general.},

 abstract = {Abstract This paper proposes a state-of-the-art branch-cut-and-price
algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands
(VRPSD). We adapt the model of Christiansen and Lysgaard [6] and
formulate the \{VRPSD\} as a set partitioning model with additional
constraints. Feasible routes are generated using a dynamic programming
algorithm executed over a state-space graph. Our method combines
2-cycle elimination with ng-routes. In addition, our pricing problem
is significantly accelerated by the introduction of a new aggregate
dominance rule. To speed up the generation of negative reduced cost
columns, we use a tabu search heuristic and a bidirectional labeling
algorithm. We also add capacity and subset-row inequalities dynamically
in order to strengthen the linear relaxation of the master problem.
As extensive computational tests illustrate, our algorithm is very
competitive with the one of [6]. We solve 20 additional instances
from the 40-instance set considered by these authors and we considerably
improve the computing times for instances already closed. We also
solve 17 new instances from the literature. },

  Abstract                 = {The vehicle routing path (VRP) is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) and therefore difficult to solve. The fact that VRP is both of theoretical and practical interest (owing to its real-world applications), explains the amount of attention given to the VRP by researchers during past years. Research on the development of heuristics for the VRP has made considerable progress since the first algorithms were proposed in the early 1960s. Several families of heuristics have been proposed for the VRP. The purpose of this paper is to review some of the most important families of heuristics for the VRP. At the end, the survey presents the solution method used for a small-scale case study in a logistic company in Turkey.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper proposes a state-of-the-art branch-cut-and-price algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD). We adapt the model of Christiansen and Lysgaard [6] and formulate the \{VRPSD\} as a set partitioning model with additional constraints. Feasible routes are generated using a dynamic programming algorithm executed over a state-space graph. Our method combines 2-cycle elimination with ng-routes. In addition, our pricing problem is significantly accelerated by the introduction of a new aggregate dominance rule. To speed up the generation of negative reduced cost columns, we use a tabu search heuristic and a bidirectional labeling algorithm. We also add capacity and subset-row inequalities dynamically in order to strengthen the linear relaxation of the master problem. As extensive computational tests illustrate, our algorithm is very competitive with the one of [6]. We solve 20 additional instances from the 40-instance set considered by these authors and we considerably improve the computing times for instances already closed. We also solve 17 new instances from the literature. },

  Review                   = {Bussiness Problem: Distribution
Industry: Oil
Objective: Minimize distribution costs, balance work load
Depot: Multiple
Constraints: Capacity, Customer Service Levels
Characteristics: Differential truck cost, Loading during the route, Heterogeneus fleet, Order size variations to meet the capacity of the truck
Technique: Not Reported
Application: DSS
Benchmark: Not Reported


Aporte:
* Implementaci√≥n de un DSS que integra de forma total el ERP de una empresa petrolera en grecia, dise√±ado para reducir los costos de transporte
 en un escenario con multiples restricciones y caracteristicas propias del problema.
* Reducci√≥n de 1.2 millones de euros anuales en costos de operaci√≥n y aumento en la utilidad de 0.25 Millones por incremento en los niveles de servicio

Ideas: 
* Utilizar una metodolog√≠a sistematica para el dise√±o de los DSS
* Incluir en el paper un diagrama de flujo de la informaci√≥n (Creo que en la tesis se incluy√≥ algo parecido)

Notas:
* El dise√±o del sistema incluy√≥ el levantamiento de requerimientos, el dise√±o conceptual y luego la implementaci√≥n.
* La implementaci√≥n no se hizo desarrollando software propio sino comprando en el mercado software para satisfacer todos los requerimientos funcionales
* Hay un buen cuadro comparativo entre las cosas que ofrecen los software comerciales que evaluaron antes de la compra
* Buenas referencias a metodolog√≠as para el dise√±o de sistemas. Queda pendiente buscar estos art√≠culos: [1], [31], [8],[35]},

  Abstract                 = {With the growth in population and development of business activities in Hong Kong, the range and level of services provided by Hongkong Post have multiplied. However, the schedule of its postal vehicles, including mail collection and delivery, is still constructed manually on a daily basis, based on the experience of staff and transportation reviews. In this paper, the problem of scheduling a set of n collection points (District Post Offices) from a depot (General Post Office) in Hong Kong Island is addressed. The objectives pursued are the maximization of resource utilization and minimization of operation costs. In other words, the variable cost is expected to be reduced. To achieve these goals, an integer linear programming (IP) model of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) is developed in an effort to obtain optimal solutions. As the model involves computational complexity, a commercial software package CPLEX is used to solve the problems efficiently. The results show that the propose},

  Abstract                 = {In practice, apart from the problem of vehicle routing, schedulers also face the problem of finding feasible driver schedules complying with complex restrictions on drivers' driving and working hours. To address this complex interdependent problem of vehicle routing and break scheduling, we propose a restricted dynamic programming heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows and the full European social legislation on drivers' driving and working hours. The problem we consider includes all rules in this legislation, whereas in the literature only a basic set of rules has been addressed. In addition to this basic set of rules, the legislation contains a set of modifications that allow for more flexibility. To include the legislation in the restricted dynamic programming heuristic, we propose a break scheduling heuristic. Computational results show that our method finds solutions to benchmark instancesówhich only consider the basic set of rulesówith 18% fewer vehicles and 5% less travel distance than state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our results are obtained with significantly less computational effort. Furthermore, the results show that including a set of rules on drivers' working hoursówhich has been generally ignored in the literatureóhas a significant impact on the resulting vehicle schedules: 3.9% more vehicle routes and 1.0% more travel distances are needed. Finally, using the modified rules of the legislation leads to an additional reduction of 4% in the number of vehicles and of 1.5% in travel distances. Therefore, the modified rules should be exploited in practice.},

  Abstract                 = {This work presents the design and implementation of a low cost scheduling tool based on Microsoft Excel, designed for a small printing company in Colombia. The company scheduling problem can be defined as a Flexible Job Shop with highly sequence dependent set up times where makespan is the objective function in a weekly planning horizon. The system architecture includes a product specifications data base, an engine which transforms the product specifications into shop floor operations, a processing times data base and a graphical user interface. The proponed scheduling tool uses Simulated Annealing (SA) for optimization purposes. An initial schedule is generated by a non-delay schedule generation algorithm combined with the MWR dispatching rule. Insertion moves on each machine were used for the generation of neighbors. The cooling schedule for the implemented SA algorithm is also well explained. In terms of the opration management, the results benefit the company with a reduction from hours to seconds on the time required to build a feasible schedule and the availability of new tools to generate reports of shop floor performance metrics. In terms of the makespan, the results suggest improvements of 40\%},

* Aplicaci√≥n para resolver con base en el conocimiento recopilado de expertos ayudado por heuristicas el problema de despacho de camiones de gasolina
 en una empresa chilena.

Ideas: 


Notas:

* El problema es complicado porque la ruta de los camiones tiene una restricci√≥n sobre el tipo de combustible que no permite a√±adir cualquier cliente a la ruta
* Para calcular las ventanas de tiempo se consideran los tiempos de carga del camion en la planta, viaje y descarga en cada cliente.

* Los tiempos de descarga dependen de cada cliente y est√°n previamente registrados en la base de datos
* Los tiempos de descarga pueden sufrir cambios pues para suplir al cliente de gasolina la estaci√≥n debe estar vacia, as√≠ que si el cami√≥n llega en un momento
 en el cual hay clientes siendo atendidos deber√° esperar a que estos se vayan para iniciar el proceso
* El sistema puede ser actualizado con nuevo conocimiento de tiempos de desplazamiento},

Different combination of routing procedures and split variants were embedded into a GRASP and a ILS and extensive computational experimentation was carried on the 14 instances of Christofides et al. \cite{Christofides1975}. Their results show when well designed, RC approaches can be competitive for solving VRPs.},

La revisi√≥n bibliogr√°fica es del VRP en l√≠neas generales y no est√° ligada al problema particular que intentan resolver. Tiene sin embargo buenas referencias a libros (en ebrary ya tengo dos en mi estante y en la biblioteca hay otro).

Industry: Food 
Objective: Distribution Cost
Depot: Single
Constraints: Capacity, Distance, Minimum load, Arc Elegibility, Number of visits
Characteristics: Heterogeneus fleet 
Technique: Enumeration algorithm followed by an integer programming model to assign routes
Application: DSS
Benchmark: Own Instantes


Aporte:
* DSS para resolver un problema con multiples restricciones en una empresa de alimentos para animales en espa√±a.
* Un algoritmo de enumeraci√≥n y asignaci√≥n para solucionar el problema.
* Reducciones de entre el 9 y el 11% en terminos de costo de distribuci√≥n.

Ideas: 
* Un algoritmo de enumeraci√≥n inplicita puede servir para problemas altamente restringidos donde el n√∫mero de soluciones
 factibles es reducido.

Notas:
* Buena estructura del paper, puede ser benchmarkable},

Industry: Retail 
Objective: Maximize the completion of service calls, Mimizimize operational cost, Maximize service levels
Depot: Multple
Constraints: Soft Time Windows, Elegibility, Capacity, Shift Duration, PDP, Number of visits
Characteristics: Pre-assigned sectors, 
Technique: Heuristics, improved with tabu search
Application: DSS
Benchmark: Not Reported


Aporte:
* Implementaci√≥n de un DSS para resolver dos problemas en Sears. El problema de rutear t√©cnicos de mantenimiento y veh√≠culos que entregan
 mercancias.
* La implementaci√≥n ahorra a sears 42 millones de dolares anuales.

Ideas: 
* La rutina para calcular las distancas es independiente de forma que si llega una nueva orden no haya que repetir todo el calculo. Algo como lo pensado
 por andr√©s para jCW.

Notas:
* Buen paper, reporta cifras muy interesantes que venden muy bien la idea
* El sistema permite asignar tiempo extra a cada veh√≠culo y t√©cnico, Asignar a los t√©cnicos sus respectivas skills, lo cual permite mayor representatividad del problema real
* Utilizan un esquema cluster-first, route-second
* La construcci√≥n de matrices OD es complicada pues las dimensiones del problema hacen que se hable de matrices muy grandes. Para solucionarlo
 los autores crearon una serie de reglas para no generar todas las posibles distancias. Muy interesante el approach para usarlo en caso de la vida real.},
