\chapter{Technical background}
In this chapter we briefly overview the main optimization techniques used on our research. We assume the reader is familiar with all these techniques, but for the sake of completeness we provide him/her with just enough technical background to easily navigate the rest of the document. We begin by introducing local search-based algorithms and quickly survey their application to vehicle routing problems. We then discuss evolutionary algorithms and highlight successful applications to VRPs. Next, we focus on order-first, split-second techniques. Finally we discuss the multi-space sampling heuristic; a tecnique
